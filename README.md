# Module 1 Challenge - Kickstarter Analysis for Louise
## Overview of Project
The project was to analyze the Kickstarter fundraising campaign Louise had been running, with an emphasis on the Theater and further focus on the Plays put on in the theater. Louise wanted to determine what the best time was to raise funds for the Theater and if there was a fundraiser goal amount that was more successful.  She could then use this information to be more directional in her future fundraising efforts in the future.
### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to learn how to analyze the data utilizing Excel techniques that include, but are not limited to:

	- Database Creation
	- Formula Creation
	- Conditional Formatting
	- Pivot Table Creation
	- Chart Creation
 ## Analysis and Challenges
 The analysis was completed through the data Louise kept on all of the Kickstarters ran from 2009 â€“ 2017. The data has to be placed in to a usable format by decoding the Unix timestamp `=(((J2/60)/60)/24)+DATE(1970,1,1)`for both the launch date and deadline.  We added a few columns of calculated data that could be usedful to our analysis, like percdentage funded and subcategory. Then for ease of use we added some conditional formating for a quick glance look at which projects were successful, live, canceled and failed and to highlight the more sucessfullu funded projects by adding color to the sheet. The conditional formatting while technically easy for me can be difficult for me to see. I am partially color-blind and using the shaded heatmap for the percentage funded column, is a nightmare since I have trouble decearning the difference between shares.  It is one of the reaon why in the real world I and my team do not use them, as to not ailenate other visualy impared people.  



### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
