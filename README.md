# Module 1 Challenge - Kickstarter Analysis for Louise
## Overview of Project
The project was to analyze the Kickstarter fundraising campaign Louise had been running, with an emphasis on the Theater and further focus on the Plays put on in the theater. Louise wanted to determine what the best time was to raise funds for the Theater and if there was a fundraiser goal amount that was more successful.  She could then use this information to be more directional in her future fundraising efforts in the future.
### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to learn how to analyze the data utilizing Excel techniques that include, but are not limited to:

	- Database Creation
	- Formula Creation
	- Conditional Formatting
	- Pivot Table Creation
	- Chart Creation
 ## Analysis and Challenges
  The analysis was completed through the data Louise kept on all of the Kickstarters ran from 2009 â€“ 2017. The data had to be placed in to a usable format by decoding the Unix timestamp `=(((J2/60)/60)/24)+DATE(1970,1,1)`for both the launch date and deadline.  We added a few columns of calculated data that could be useful to our analysis, like percentage funded and subcategory. Then for ease of use we added some conditional formatting for a quick glance look at which projects were successful, live, canceled and failed and to highlight the more successfully funded projects by adding color to the sheet. The conditional formatting while technically easy for me can be difficult for me to see. I am partially color-blind and using the shaded heatmap for the percentage funded column, is a nightmare since I have trouble discerning the difference between shades. In the exercise we were to use a blue to a red heatmap and this is how it turned out.

  I have learned due to my unique colorblindness and my teammate who has traditional red/green blindness my team works to show data without heatmaps and conditionally formatting as much as we can so has to no alienate other visually impaired people.  
   The remaining analysis of the challenge was not bad. I found most of the pivot table and calculations to be easy with the exception of the the COUNTIFS when you had a range of dollars. I did not want to use the hint in the Module Challenge either and tried searching for the answer in internet. The search was fruitless, since the term "Range" would pull in the range formula or everything but what I was looking for.  So when I finally watched the hint, I realized I was close by putting both range numbers in the formula, I was just not seperating them by the column range each time as the final code came out `=COUNTIFS(Kickstarter!D:D,">=1000",Kickstarter!F:F, "successful",Kickstarter!D:D,"<=4999",Kickstarter!R:R,"plays")`. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The launch date analysis shows and overall success rate of about 65% and a 36% fail rate for theater fundraising. The most successful time frame for fundraising is spring and summer and then it falls off in the fall and winter. https://github.com/Normanfamdamly/Kickstarter_Analysis/blob/main/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png    
Except for a small blip in February, I think most fund raising for theater activities should be focused around the spring and summer seasons.  The least successful time for fundraising is the month of December, most likely due to the holidays and competition for other charitable donations.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The play fundraiser goals had a very interesting outcome.  The goal amounts that are successful vs, the amounts that fail are a reversed mirror image of each other.
https://github.com/Normanfamdamly/Kickstarter_Analysis/blob/main/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png  The graph intersects 4 times over the chart and with one point being on the goal of $15,000 to $19,999.  In this point of intersection there is a 50/50 change of the fundraiser goal being successful or failing. Most goal amounts have a50% change or more of being successful except for $25,000 to $35,000 and $45,000 to $49,999. These three have a success rate of 20% or lower. The sweet spot of 65% or higher of success is $0 to $5000, $35,000 to $44,999 and $50,000+.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?


	I have concluded that to be successful Louise should look to launch her fundraising in the Spring or Summer months.  It is also best to not 
	launch any fundraise in December since that appears to be the worst month based on launch date.  Interestingly the only month a campaign did 
	not have to be canceled was October.


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
 
	The outcome on fundraising showed Louise has 75% chance of hitting 50% or more of her fundraising goal in any amount she tries to raise. There 
	are only 3 fundraising goals that have a success rate of 20% or lower and those are $25,000 to $35,000 and $45,000 to $49,999. 
	The most interesting outcome is the fact that the outcomes between the successful and failed are a flipped mirror image of each other.  

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

	The dataset is limited to how successful the fundraising is to its goal.  It should really be a comparison to the success of the event.
	It would be good to know how much money they are making off the events they raise money to fund. The data was lacking an auto convert
	to one monetary unit to make it an apples-to-apples comparison between countries as well.


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

	Making more tables around the countries and what categories were the most successful in each and then breaking it down by subcategory 
	would have been interesting to see.  Charting the outcomes year by year would have been interesting to see if past world events had 
	an effect on the charitable affects of doners.
